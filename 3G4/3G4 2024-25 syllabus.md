## Content

The main application area considered in the module is diagnostic medical imaging: 3D data is acquired using one of the clinical imaging modalities (e.g. CT), represented as a voxel array or segmented into surfaces, then visualised using computer graphics techniques. While medical imaging is the focus of the course, many of the techniques used to segment, represent and visualise the 3D data sets are generic and can equally be applied to other types of data, such as CAD models.
