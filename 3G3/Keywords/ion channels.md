• Ion channels are protein pores embedded in neuronal membranes that allow selective passage of ions such as Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cl⁻.  
• Voltage-gated ion channels are crucial for generating and propagating action potentials along axons.  
• Ligand-gated (ionotropic) receptors at synapses open in response to neurotransmitter binding, leading to rapid changes in postsynaptic membrane conductance.  
• Ion channels determine whether a postsynaptic cell becomes excited (via depolarization) or inhibited (via hyperpolarization), thus influencing neural signaling.  
• Their precise regulation underpins the timing and strength of neuronal communication across networks.
