- Both ionotropic receptors activated by glutamate, found together in the neural membrane
- Both receptors when open allow sodium and potassium ions to move through
- Weak stimulation only activates the AMPA receptors, resulting in a **slight** [[depolarization]] of the post-synaptic neuron
- The pore of the NMDA receptor is blocked by a magnesium ion under low stimulus strength, thus the EPSP is mediated by AMPA mostly
	- This Mg²⁺ block prevents ion flow even when glutamate is bound. 
	- Meanwhile, AMPA receptors, which are not blocked by magnesium, quickly open and mediate the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). 
	- Only when the EPSP generated by AMPA activation is strong enough does the membrane depolarize sufficiently to expel the Mg²⁺ from the NMDA receptor channel, allowing it to contribute to synaptic transmission and plasticity.
	- Given stimulus of sufficient strength and frequency, the magnesium ion blocking NMDA receptor is removed, NMDA opens allowing not only sodium and potassium ions through, but also **calcium ions**
- Calcium effect:
	- The calcium ion acts as a **second messenger** allowing for **signaling cascade**
		- Some calcium binds to calmodulin
		- Calmodulin binds to protein kinases such as CaMKII (Cam kinase)
		- CaMKII phosphorylates existing AMPA receptors, **increasing its conductivity**
		- CaMKII also promotes movement of AMPA receptors from **intracellular stores onto the membrane**
	- Calcium may also **facilitate the release of transmitters** from the axon terminal via **retrograde signal**
	- In any case, the connection strength at the synapse is enhanced, which may lead to LTP
