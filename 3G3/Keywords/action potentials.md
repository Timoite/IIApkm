An action potential is the rapid, all-or-nothing change in a neuron's membrane potential. Although it's produced by ionic currents (primarily through sodium and potassium channels), it is not just a gradual voltage change—it’s a regenerative process. 

A small initial current depolarizes the membrane until a threshold is reached, which then triggers a large, rapid influx of Na⁺ ions, followed by K⁺ ions restoring the potential.

#### Step-by-step action potential in a synaptic connection

1. Presynaptic cell before firing:
    - The neuron receives incoming [[signals (excitatory or inhibitory)]] at its [[dendrites]].
    - These inputs sum up at the cell body and axon hillock. If the combined signal makes the membrane potential less negative enough to reach a certain threshold, the neuron is triggered to fire an action potential.
2. Firing (action potential generation):
    - Once the threshold is reached at the axon hillock, voltage-gated sodium (Na⁺) channels open rapidly.
    - This causes a swift influx of Na⁺, leading to a steep depolarization—the "firing" of the action potential.
    - Following the peak, voltage-gated potassium (K⁺) channels open to repolarize the membrane back to its resting state.
3. Presynaptic cell after firing:
    - The action potential travels down the axon to the presynaptic terminal.
    - Arrival of the action potential at the terminal causes voltage-gated calcium (Ca²⁺) channels to open.
    - The incoming Ca²⁺ triggers [[synaptic vesicles]] to fuse with the [[membrane]], thereby releasing neurotransmitters into the [[synaptic cleft]].
4. Postsynaptic cell response:
    - Neurotransmitters cross the narrow synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
    - This binding alters the postsynaptic cell's permeability to ions, generating either an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).
    - If the net effect of these postsynaptic potentials makes the membrane sufficiently depolarized (reaching its threshold), the postsynaptic neuron will also fire an action potential.

#### Role of action potential in chemical synapses

In most chemical synapses, action potential will not be travelling accross different neurons, it's the neurotransmitter triggered by it that will travel across pre and post synaptic cell. 

In a chemical synapse, the action potential travels along the axon of the presynaptic neuron until it reaches its terminal. There, the depolarization triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, potentially initiating a new action potential there.

While chemical synapses use neurotransmitters to convey signals between cells, electrical synapses can allow direct electrical communication through [[gap junctions]], but this is not the major case of neural circuit.
