**Serotonin increases sensitization of the Aplysia gill withdrawal reflex through a well-studied molecular pathway involving G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), G-proteins, and downstream signaling cascades. Here’s a step-by-step outline of the process:**

1. **Sensitization Trigger:**  
   A noxious stimulus (like a tail shock) activates interneurons that release **serotonin (5-HT)** onto the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons involved in the gill withdrawal reflex.

2. **Serotonin Receptor Activation:**  
   **Serotonin binds to 5-HT receptors** (a type of GPCR) located on the presynaptic membrane of the sensory neuron.

3. **G-Protein Activation:**  
   The activated **5-HT GPCR** causes a conformational change that activates an associated **G-protein** (specifically, the Gs subtype).

4. **Adenylyl Cyclase Activation:**  
   The **Gs protein** stimulates **adenylyl cyclase**, an enzyme that converts ATP to **cyclic AMP (cAMP)**.

5. **cAMP and Protein Kinase A (PKA):**  
   The increase in **cAMP** activates **protein kinase A (PKA)**.

6. **Phosphorylation of Potassium Channels:**  
   **PKA phosphorylates specific potassium (K⁺) channels** (especially S-type K⁺ channels) in the presynaptic membrane, causing them to close.

7. **Prolonged Action Potential:**  
   With fewer open K⁺ channels, the **action potential duration increases** in the sensory neuron terminal.

8. **Increased Calcium Influx:**  
   The longer action potential allows **more Ca²⁺ to enter** the presynaptic terminal during depolarization.

9. **Enhanced Neurotransmitter Release:**  
   The increased Ca²⁺ leads to **greater release of neurotransmitter (glutamate)** onto the motor neuron.

10. **Stronger Gill Withdrawal:**  
    The **motor neuron receives a larger excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)**, resulting in a **stronger gill withdrawal reflex**.

**Summary:**  
**Serotonin, acting through 5-HT GPCRs and Gs proteins, increases cAMP and activates PKA, which phosphorylates and closes K⁺ channels. This prolongs the action potential, increases Ca²⁺ influx, and enhances neurotransmitter release, leading to sensitization of the gill withdrawal reflex.**

**Key components:**
- **Serotonin (5-HT)**
- **5-HT GPCRs**
- **Gs G-protein**
- **Adenylyl cyclase**
- **cAMP**
- **PKA**
- **K⁺ channels**
- **Ca²⁺ influx**
- **Glutamate release**

This pathway is a classic example of **modulatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity** underlying simple forms of learning.
