Habituation results from an Activity-Dependent Presynaptic Depression of Synaptic Transmission.
- Touching the siphon excites a population of mechanoreceptor sensory neurons that innervate the siphon
- The release of glutamate from sensory neuron terminals generates **fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)** in the interneurons and motor cells
- EPSPs from sensory and interneurons summate on motor cells both temporally and spatially
- The motor cells discharge strongly, thereby producing withdrawal of the gill
- If stimulus is repeated. **EPSPs produced by sensory neurons in both interneurons and motor cells progressively decrease** paralleling the habituation of gill withdrawal.
- In addition, repeated stimulation also leads to a decrease in the **strength of synaptic transmission** from the excitatory interneurons to themotor neurons
	- This is due to the amount of **glutamate** released from **presynaptic terminals** of sensory neurons **decreases**
	- Fewer synaptic vesicles are released with each action potential in the sensory neuron
	- This reduction is referred as **homosynaptic depression**. As the sensitivity of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors does not change because the reduction in transmission occurs in the **active pathway** itself and does not require another modulatory cell
- In Aplysia a single session of 10 stimuli leads to a short-term habituation lasting few minutes, four sessions separated by resting periods produce long-term habituation lasting around 3 weeks.
	- **Long term habituation** is caused by a **decrease in the number of synaptic contacts between sensory and motor neurons**
