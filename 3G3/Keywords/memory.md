### Cellular Mechanisms of Implicit Memory Storage

There are two major forms of memory, **implicit** and **explicit** memory.

#### Implicit memory
![[73398.png]]
- Operates unconsciously and automatically
- For habits and perceptual and motor skills
- Long term storage requires a family of structures:
	- The **neocortex** handles **priming**, which helps process **familiar stimuli** more efficiently.
	- The **striatum** is involved in **skills and habits**, such as riding a bike
	- The **amygdala** stores learned **fear responses** that occur without deliberate memory recall.
	- The **cerebellum** supports learned **motor skills**, coordinating complex movements.
	- Reflex pathways manage simple, non-associative learning like [[habituation]] (reduced response to repeated stimuli) and [[sensitization]] (increased response).


#### Explicit memory

- Operate consciously
- Memory for people, places and objects
- Long term storage of explicit memory begins in the [[hippocampus]] and the **medial temporal lobe** of the neocortex
