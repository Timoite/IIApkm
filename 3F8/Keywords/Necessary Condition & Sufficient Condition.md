- **Necessary Condition:** A condition that _must_ be true if a point is an optimum (minimum or maximum). However, satisfying the necessary condition does _not_ guarantee that the point is an optimum. It's like saying, "If it's raining, then the ground is wet." Wet ground is necessary for rain, but wet ground doesn't _guarantee_ it's raining (it could be from a sprinkler).
- **Sufficient Condition:** A condition that, if true, _guarantees_ that a point is an optimum. However, the optimum may still occur even if the sufficient condition is _not_ met. It's like saying, "If you have a winning lottery ticket, you will be rich." Having a winning ticket is sufficient to be rich, but you can be rich without winning the lottery.
