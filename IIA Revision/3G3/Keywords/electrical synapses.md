Employed primarily to send rapid and stereotyped depolarizing signals.

Electrical synapses involve gap junctions that allow ions (and other small molecules) to pass directly between adjacent cells, providing very fast and bidirectional communication. In contrast, when an action potential travels along a neuron, it leads to the release of neurotransmitters at the presynaptic terminalâ€”this is chemical synapse communication, where the neurotransmitters cross the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell to propagate the signal. 

Essentially, electrical synapses rely on direct ionic flow between cells, while [[chemical synapses]] use neurotransmitter release triggered by an action potential.
