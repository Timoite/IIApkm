Chemical synapses are capable of more variable signaling and thus can produce more complex behaviors. 

They rely on the release of diverse neurotransmitters and have receptors that can modulate responses, allowing for adaptable and nuanced signal transmission and plasticity.

#### Properties
- Chemical synapses can be either [[signals (excitatory or inhibitory)|excitatory or ingibitory]] 
	- The neurotransmitters they release bind to different types of receptors on the postsynaptic cell. 
	- This binding can open ion channels that either depolarize (excite) or hyperpolarize (inhibit) the cell, depending on the specific receptor and ion flow involved.
- Can produce electrical changes in the postsynaptic cell that last from milliseconds to many minutes
	- Fast electrical responses, lasting only milliseconds, are mediated by **ionotropic receptors** that open ion channels immediately upon neurotransmitter binding. 
	- Slower responses—lasting seconds to minutes—involve **metabotropic receptors**, which trigger intracellular signaling cascades that modulate the cell’s activity.
- San amplify neuronal signals
	- when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, it triggers the release of many neurotransmitter molecules. 
	- These molecules then bind to multiple receptors on the postsynaptic cell, producing a larger postsynaptic response than the original presynaptic signal. 
	- This amplification is further enhanced by the involvement of metabotropic receptors, whose signaling cascades can increase or prolong the effect of the neurotransmitter, thereby boosting the overall signal transmission.
- No direct low-resistance pathway between pre- and postsynaptic cells
- Action potential in presynaptic neuron initiates the release of a chemical [[neurotransmitter]] which diffuses across the synaptic cleft to interact with receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic cells.

#### Exocytosis

It is the process by which neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. Here’s how it works:

1. During a presynaptic action potential, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open at the activation zone.
2. Ca²⁺ ions enter the presynaptic terminal; this rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ triggers a biochemical reaction.
3. The reaction causes synaptic vesicles loaded with neurotransmitters to fuse with the presynaptic membrane.
4. The transmitter molecules then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to their receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane
	1. Which in turn activates the receptors
	2. Leading to the opening or closing of ion channels
	3. Resulting flux of ions alters the membrane conductance and potential of postsynaptic cell.

This sequence ensures that the electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal, enabling communication between neurons.

These steps cause a delay that can be from 0.3ms to several milliseconds. Although chemical transmission lacks the speed of electrical synapses, it has the property of amplification:
- Just one synaptic vesicle releases several thousand molecules of transmitter
- These transmitters can together open thousands of ion channels in the target cell
- Small presynaptic nerve terminal, which generates only a weak electrical current can depolarize a large postsynaptic cell.
