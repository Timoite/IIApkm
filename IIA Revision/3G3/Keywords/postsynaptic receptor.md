All receptors for chemical transmitters have two biochemical features in common:
- They are membrane spanning proteins, the region exposed to the external environment of the cell recongnizes and binds the transmitter from the presynaptic cell.
- They carry out an effector function within the target cell, the receptors typically influence the opening or closing of [[ion channels]]

Neurotransmitters control the opening of ion channels in the postsynaptic cell either directly or indirectly.

### Ionotropic receptors
- Receptors that gate ion channels directly such as the ACh (Acetylcholine) receptor at the neuromuscular junction
- Composed of four or five subunits that form a single macromolecule
- Contain both an **extracellular domain** that forms the binding site for the transmitter and a **membrane-spanning domain** that forms an ion conducting pore
- Upon binding neurotransmitter, the receptor undergoes **a conformational change** that opens the channel
- Produce relatively fast synaptic actions lasting **only milliseconds**, commonly found at synapses in neural circuits that **mediate rapid behaviors**
- Ionotropic glutamate receptors have been divided into four subtypes on the basis of their ligand binding properties and sequence similarity: **[[AMPA, NMDA]], kainate, and delta receptors** (See [[AMPA, NMDA]] for more details)


### Metabotropic receptors
- Receptors that gate [[ion channels]] indirectly, like the several types of receptors for [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] in neurons of the cerebral cortex. 
- Normally composed of one or at most two subunits that are distinct from the ion channels they regulate
	- Metabotropic receptors typically consist of one or two subunits that are separate from the ion channels they regulate. 
	- Unlike ionotropic receptors, metabotropic receptors do not form the channel themselves
	- Instead, when a neurotransmitter binds to a metabotropic receptor, it activates intracellular signaling pathways (usually via G proteins) that then modulate separate ion channels or other cellular processes
	- This structural and functional separation allows them to produce **slower, longer-lasting responses** compared to the rapid responses seen with ionotropic receptors.
- **Activation of these receptors often stimulates the production of second messengers** such as cAMP and diacyglycerol
- Many of the second messengers active protein kinases, enzymes that phosphorylate different substrate proteins
- In many cases the protein kinases directly phosphorylate ion channels, leading to their opening and closing
- Produce slower synaptic actions lasting seconds to minutes, can modulate behavior by **altering the excitability of neurons and the strength of the synaptic connections**
- Often act as **crucial reinforcing pathways in the process of learning**.
- In the picture below, we see that the receptors are composed of a single subunit which activate a **guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein (G protein)** which in turn stimulates **adenylyl cyclase which converts ATP to cAMP**, the cAMP activates the **cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA)** which **phosphorylates the channel**, leading to a change in function.
