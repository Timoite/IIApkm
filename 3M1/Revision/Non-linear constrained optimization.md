Below is a concise cheatsheet-style summary of the key concepts from Lecture 6: Nonlinear Constrained Optimization. Imagine it as a handy reference card you can look at while working through problems.

--------------------------------------------------
# Cheat Sheet: Nonlinear Constrained Optimization

## 1. Problem Formulation
- **Objective:** Minimize (or maximize) an objective function, f(x), subject to constraints.
- **Types of Constraints:**
  - **Equality Constraints:** \( h(x) = 0 \)
  - **Inequality Constraints:** $g(x) \leq 0$

--------------------------------------------------
## 2. Lagrangian Formulation
- **Purpose:** Incorporates the constraints into the objective function.
- **For Equality Constraints:**
  - **Lagrangian:** 
    $$ L(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i\, h_i(x) $$
  - Each multiplier \(\lambda_i\) enforces the condition \( h_i(x) = 0 \).
- **For Inequality Constraints:**
  - When handled in a similar fashion:
    $$ L(x, \mu) = f(x) + \sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j\, g_j(x) $$
  - Note: The treatment of inequality constraints often involves complementary slackness conditions.

--------------------------------------------------
## 3. Barrier Methods (Interior-Point Methods)
- **Idea:** Modify the objective function with a barrier term that "pushes" iterates away from the boundary of the feasible region.
- **Logarithmic Barrier Function:**
  - For an inequality constraint \( g(x) \leq 0 \), add the term:
    $$ \phi(x) = -\mu\, \ln\bigl(-g(x)\bigr) $$
  - Here, \(\mu > 0\) is a parameter controlling the barrier.
- **Key Behavior:**
  - As \( g(x) \to 0^- \) (i.e., near the constraint boundary), 
    $$ -\ln\bigl(-g(x)\bigr) \to +\infty $$
  - This divergence (logarithmic blow-up) **ensures iterates remain strictly in the interior** of the feasible region because moving toward or past the boundary incurs an infinitely high cost.

--------------------------------------------------
## 4. Insights on Constraint Handling
- **Equality Constraints (Mandatory Checkpoints):**
  - Must be exactly satisfied (similar to having a fixed checkpoint on a road trip).
- **Inequality Constraints (Speed Limits):**
  - Provide a range of acceptable values, but once active (pushing the boundary), they tightly influence the solution.
- **Infeasibility Prevention:**
  - The steep barrier function (diverging to \(+\infty\)) near the constraint boundary prevents the algorithm from stepping into the infeasible region.
- **Parameter Impact:**
  - The parameter \(\mu\) determines the *steepness* of the barrier. A large \(\mu\) imposes a harsher penalty near the boundary, while a smaller \(\mu\) allows iterates to approach closer to the boundary, balancing convergence speed and feasibility.

--------------------------------------------------
## 5. Key Takeaways
- **Constraint Types:**
  - Equality constraints force a solution to exactly meet a specific condition.
  - Inequality constraints define a boundary that solutions must respect.
- **Lagrangian Efficiency:**
  - Incorporates constraints directly into the optimization process via multipliers.
- **Barrier Function Role:**
  - Prevents infeasible solutions by making the cost of approaching the boundary prohibitively high (diverging as \(-\ln(\text{distance to boundary})\)).
- **Practical Consideration:**
  - Starting from a strictly feasible point is crucial, and the choice of \(\mu\) is a key tuning knob in practical implementations.
